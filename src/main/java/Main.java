//Part 1: Get the number of pets and their details
//-initialize scanner (import java.util.Scanner)
//-ask the user: "How many pets do you have?"
//-store the number of pets, utilizing an int
//-use a loop to go through the number of pets:
//-for each pet, ask: What kind of pet is this (bird, dog, cat)?
//-ask whatâ€™s the name of the pet
//-store the pet's type and name
//-at the end, print out the list of pets and their names.
//
//Part 2: Create a Pet class and subclasses
//Create a Pet class:
//-create name for class
//-create a setter and getter for name.
//-create a speak method in Pet (this will be overridden in subclasses).
//Create subclasses for specific pet types (mine: dog, cat, bird):
//-in each subclass, override the speak method (@Override) with sound for that pet
//Ex:
//-dog: speaks "Woof!"
//-cat: speaks "Purr!"
//bird: speaks "Chirp!"
//

//Part 3: Modify the program to use the Pet class
//-ask user (ex. part 1) for number of pets and their details (type and name)
//Create an empty list to store pet:
//-loop through the number of pets
//-based on the pet type (dog, cat, bird), create subclass each pet type (dog, cat, bird)
//-set the pet's name using the setter
//-add the pet object to the list
//at the end, loop through the list of pets and,
//-print each pet's name
//-call the speak method to print the sound the pet makes
